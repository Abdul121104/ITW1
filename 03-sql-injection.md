3. Exploiting SQL Injection :


# Exploiting SQL Injection

SQL injection is a common web application vulnerability that occurs when malicious SQL queries are executed by an attacker. Understanding SQL injection is crucial for ethical hackers to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities.

## Basic SQL Injection

```sql
 OR 1=1 --
 ```
This input might bypass authentication and grant access to the system.
