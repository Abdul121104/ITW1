# Introduction to Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, involves legally and responsibly testing the security of systems. It is a crucial aspect of ensuring that systems are protected from potential threats.

In this section, we'll cover some fundamental concepts and terminology commonly used in ethical hacking.

## Using the `ping` Command

The `ping` command is a basic tool for network troubleshooting. It's often used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Here's how to use it:

ping example.com
This command will send ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request packets to example.com and display the results, including response times and packet loss.

### Explanation

- The `ping` command tests the connectivity between your system and a target host.
- It sends echo request packets to the target host and waits for echo reply packets.
- The response times and packet loss are used to assess network performance and connectivity.

The `ping` command is often the first step in network troubleshooting and can help identify network issues and connectivity problems.

## Exercise

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Use the `ping` command to test the connectivity to a website of your choice. For example, `ping google.com`.
3. Observe the results, including response times and packet loss.
4. Experiment with different hostnames and observe the variations in response times.

This exercise will help you become familiar with the `ping` command and understand how to use it to test network connectivity.
