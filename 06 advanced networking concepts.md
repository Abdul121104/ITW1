## Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are secure communication channels that allow users to access resources on a private network over the internet. They are critical for remote work and securing data in transit.

Learn about the basics of VPNs, their types, and how to configure and secure VPN connections.

## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are security mechanisms that monitor network traffic for malicious activity and take action to prevent unauthorized access.

Discover the differences between IDS and IPS, deployment strategies, and configurations.

## Firewalls and Configuration

Firewalls are essential for controlling network traffic and protecting against threats. Proper firewall configuration is crucial for network security.

Explore firewall types, best practices for configuration, and examples of firewall rules.

## Network Segmentation and DMZ Design

Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller segments to improve security and manageability. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a key component of network security.

Learn about network segmentation strategies, DMZ design, and their roles in securing networks.

## Subnetting and IP Addressing Schemes

Subnetting is the practice of dividing an IP network into sub-networks or subnets. Proper subnetting and IP addressing schemes are fundamental for efficient network management.

Understand subnetting, IP address allocation, and strategies for addressing network devices.

## Practical Network Design

Real-world network design scenarios are often complex and require careful planning to ensure both security and performance.

Explore practical network design examples, configurations, and best practices.

## Exercises

Hands-on exercises will be provided in this section to help you practice configuring secure network architectures and implementing advanced networking concepts.

Maintain a focus on security while designing and managing networks to protect against threats and vulnerabilities.
